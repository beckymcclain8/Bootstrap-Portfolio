            <img src="../Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/Becky.jpg" alt= "Becky McClain" id="responsive-image">

            <p>My name is Becky McClain.  I received my B.S. in Elementary Education from Northern Illinois University.  I moved to Arizona in 2005 and got my first teaching position that same year.  I taught 6th grade math for one year in Coolidge, AZ.  After a year of traveling that far each day, I decided to look for a job closer to home! I was fortunate to find a position at Sanborn Elementary school in Chandler teaching 5th grade. I taught there for nine years.</p>
          
            <p>I got married in 2007 and went back to school at ASU in 2009 to receive my Masters in Curriculum and Instruction in math education.  A year later we had our fist kiddo... Riley Rose!  Our lives were forever changed...  We have since then added two more kids to our family, Cooper and Henley. Yes I was one of those crazy people that had three kids under the age of three...</p>
          
            <p>Life started to feel a little too busy at that point. I decided my heart was no longer in teaching and that I wasn't giving my best to my kids and my home life.  So after a lot of thought and debate I decided to leave teaching.  It was a shock as I never considered a career outside of teaching.</p>
      
            <p>I quickly found a part time job working for a fund raising company.  It was perfect for this stage in my life!  I was still connected with schools, I was able to spend a good amount of time with my kids, and I still felt like I was contributing to my family!</p>
      
            <p>Within a few years life started feeling a little boring... like I wasn't doing enough, or living up to the potential I have, so I started thinking about what else is out there... and that's when I found coding!</p>
      
            <p>I spent a little time playing around with codeacademy, and the next thing I knew I found this bootcamp and it felt like the perfect opportunity to try something exciting and new!</p>
      
            <p>So here I am...  </p>
